              I'm <b>Karishma</b>, a passionate computer engineer. I'm currently
              a master's student at the <b>University of Georgia, USA</b> in the
              <b> MS Computer Science</b> Program. My coursework revolves around

              specializing in the generation of complex contract reports and
              crafting a user-friendly UI within the client's application -
              specifically, Oracle CPQ.

              and acrylic paints as well as digital art with software such as
              Procreate. My
